X0  X1  Y0  Y1
Only the first four whitespace-separated tokens are read from this file.
They are parsed as integers.
X0 is the left edge of the board, corresponding to an output of -1.
X1 is the right edge, output of 1.
Same for Y0 and Y1.
If X1 is less than X0, the x output will be inverted.
If X0 = X1, there will likely be a divide by zero error.
