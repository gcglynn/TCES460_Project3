# TCES460_Project3
Ball balancing fun

DESCRIPTION

The goal of this project is to build a complete embedded system that leverages image detection and a control system to identify the ball and manipulate the platform angle and position to center the ball.

 

Shown below (please see the PDF description for the picture) is a terribly crude drawing of the minimal system you must build. Similar to project #2, you will use a USB video camera to monitor the position of the ball on the surface. You will use several servos attached to the flat surface to control the angle of the surface and to manage the position of the ball. We will once again use the Intel Edison for analyzing captured images and controlling the angle of the surface on which the ball is placed.  

 

You may construct your flat, planar surface out of any material. For example, you may use the flat, Lego-based surfaces that are available in the lab (reference the prototype Bob built); you could use a piece of Plexiglas, metal, wood, or anything else that is sufficiently flat such that a ball can roll on the surface. The flat plane system must be attached to a minimum of two servos that you will use to tilt the surface of the plane to center the ball on the surface without falling off. You can choose to use more servos if you desire and you may use any mechanical connection of your choosing to connect the servos to the surface.

 

You will use your USB-based camera (from Project #2) mounted above the surface to detect the position of the ball on the surface and control the servos to center the ball. You will have to detect and recognize the ball in a given frame, identify its position on the surface, and activate the servos appropriately to move the ball towards the center. You may choose to use any type of ball you desire, although we have purchased numerous lightweight, ping pong-like balls for you to use. Please see Bob to get your balls.

 

 

 

Project Completion/Submission Requirements

(1) Demo - you must demo your working ball balancing system during our lab/class time on Thursday, March 10, 2016.
(2) Your system should be able to identify the location of the ball on the planar surface and actuate the servos directly attached to the surface to center the ball without falling off the surface.
(3) You must submit a single copy of a write-up in the form of a simple project report that includes the details below.  Please submit this via Canvas.  Only a single group member must submit on behalf of the group.  
  (a) Challenges faced completing this project
  (b) How you overcame 2-3 of those challenges (steps, things you tried that worked, things you tried that failed
(4) What you learned from this project 
(5) What would you build and construct in Version 2.0 if you had to it again?
(6) Group member names & team member contribution grading â€“ each team member should grade the other members of their team based on contribution to completion of the project
(7) Software environment/language used and justification for using it.
(8) You must also develop and present a single post-mortem slide that captures:
  (a) Key challenges faced and how you overcame them.  (e.g. #5 above)
  (b) What you would do differently next time
